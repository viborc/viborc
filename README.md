# Hey, I’m Vibor 👋

### Builder · Generalist-with-Depth · DevRel, Community & Growth

I’m **Head of Community Growth at [Daydream](https://daydream.live)**, building the community around **real-time AI video models and world models**. I love playing with and contributing to **[Scope](https://github.com/daydreamlive/scope)**, an open-source tool for running real-time, interactive AI pipelines.

But I wear more than one hat:
- **Ops & Community** — Ran day-to-day ops and community at **Lovable.dev** (the AI-first app builder that evolved from GPT-Engineer).
- **Founder & agency leader** — 14 years building and scaling two UX / software-dev agencies shipping products used by 100s of millions.
- **Early OSS Maintainer** — Helped maintain and grow **GPT-Engineer** (50k+ ⭐ on GitHub / 10k+ Discord) before it evolved into Lovable.
- **Microsoft alum** — Cut my teeth at Microsoft (Croatia & Denmark), pre cloud-first era.
